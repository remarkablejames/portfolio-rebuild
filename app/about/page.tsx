                            their web frameworks. I am a big fan of the open-source community, and I try to give back as

                            I am more of a self-taught developer, I started coding before going to college.
                            I like to work on the backend of the web, building
                            APIs and Microservices but my front-end skills in React.js are sharper than Ninjat≈ç . I have
                            built complex backend systems using Java, and C# throughout my formal education at Algonquin
                            College, where I am currently pursuing a college diploma in Web Development and Internet
                            Applications.
