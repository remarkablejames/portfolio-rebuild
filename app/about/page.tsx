                            I have been coding for over 3 years now. I like to work on the backend of the web, building APIs and Microservices but my front-end skills in React.js are sharper than Ninjat≈ç . I have built complex backend systems using Java, and C# throughout my formal education at Algonquin College, where I am currently pursuing a college diploma in Web Development and Internet Applications.
